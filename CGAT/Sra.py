Sra.py - methods for dealing with short read archive files
==========================================================

Utility functions for dealing with short read archive files

Requirements:
* fastq-dump >= 2.1.7

        will take place in a temporary directory, which will be deleted
        afterwards.

    # If file cotains paired end data:
    # output = prefix_1.fastq.gz, prefix_2.fastq.gz
    #    *special case: unpaired reads in a paired end --> prefix.fastq.gz
    #    *special case: if paired reads are stored in a single read,
    #                   fastq-dump will split. There might be a joining
    #                   sequence. The output would thus be:
